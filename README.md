## Description
**Be Fresh** is an app created to conveniently keep track of groceries and their expiration date. It will notify the user if any products are going to expire soon and will also offer AI powered recipes suggestions with products the user owns to facility the use of all the products they own.â€¯ 

Our app can be used independently or be accompanied by a device that will scan barcodes and add the items listed to the app for the user.

## Why?
Our mission is to make an app to resolve the common issue that a lot of people face daily which is **food waste**. It is a common experience to buy groceries and lose track of them which leads to things going bad and being thrown out.
